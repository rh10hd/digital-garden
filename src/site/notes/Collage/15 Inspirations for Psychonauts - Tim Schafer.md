前一阵子在刷油管的时候发现了Double Fine给Tim Schafer做的小问答，鉴于我是双喜和Psychonauts的粉丝，我自然不能错过。视频还蛮有意思的，认真看完以后我发现自己和Tim最大的共同点就是都很爱关于大脑、精神的东西，喜欢看人类的大脑、潜意识究竟会产生什么神奇的东西。

下面就简单地摘录了点Tim做Psychonauts的灵感来源。之后我也要抽空来看看。

**movie**: 

- Dreamscape 1984
- The New Legend of Shaolin 新少林五祖 （Tim说被这部电影里谢苗饰演的小男主所吸引，想着可以做一部以一个10岁小男孩为主角的游戏，这也是Raz的灵感来源）
- The Fly II
- Firestarter
- The Nightmare before Christmas
- Black Velvetopia

**books**: 

- Haruki Murakmi: End of the world and hard-boiled wonderland 村上春树-世界末日与冷酷异境

**artists**: 

- Joe Sorren（Psychonauts中人物的形象设计来源）
- Jean-Michel Basquiat（Psychonauts中收集品figments的设计来源）
- Paul Klee 

**games**: 

- Super Mario 64（这个似乎是Tim在制作Psychonauts时常常玩的游戏）
- Skies of Arcadia （Psychonauts一些mechanics的灵感来源）
- The Suffering

下面这段话是Tim对于制作游戏过程的理解，个人觉得蛮有意思的，所以也特意记录了下来，不只是做游戏，只要是和团队合作相关的事情，似乎都不可避免地会以这样的模式发展。

> Everybody is, like, a hundred-percent sure that their version of the story is right... Games are bringing together a lot of creative people and creative people collaborating on something is really interesting. 

> But there's this thing were ideas come from, is not always one place. And you might be a hundred-percent sure that it came form this one place, but to someone else, their start of that journey to that idea where you met and had an idea together could have started somewhere else. 

> And so, they think it came from here, and you think it came from here. And it was when you both described your ideas, the overlap became the idea that got into the work, and eventually comes to make something like a game.
